Like everyone else, I tend to forget what I read if I don't use it often.
Traditional note-taking didn't work for me because I rarely reviewed my notes.

Instead, I started recording topics into simple text files — later feeding them to AI to quiz me or summarize the material.
Manually opening editors every 20 minutes just got annoying.

This tiny tool was my solution.
It's small, simple — but it fits right into my workflow and actually helps me stay consistent.

Built with a bit of boredom, a lot of curiosity, and no unnecessary overhead.
Plus Scripting is super fun xD.
